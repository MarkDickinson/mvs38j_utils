I played with the Turnkey3 distribution of MVS3.8J
Certainly not a native distribution, I updated every utility
shipped with it to later versions as I find them.

I have moved onto TK4- and that is an important note, some of the
usermods I provide here have moved from being TK3 specific to TK4-
specific; they are not always interchangeable.

But I have found a need (or an itch) to create additional tools
that fit my specific needs, so here they are.

Miscellaneous utilities I have used to make MVS3.8J under hercules
more totally hands off and user friendly for myself.

Pushed to github as I don't want to lose the code, and my dev machine
is failing and may be dead by the time anyone reads this.

Nothing here is guaranteed to work in your own MV#3.8J environment
as we all customise our own in wierd and wonderful ways.

The comments in each file should contain documentation and 
installation instructions.

The sections are currently
==========================
linux     - scripts used to make running TK3/TK4- under hercules easier
mvs38j    - various utilities I needed to make the system look 
            after itself
mvs38j_personal_usermods - SMP usermods I need that I don't want to
            accidentally misplace so backed up here
