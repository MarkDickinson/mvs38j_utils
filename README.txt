I play with the Turnkey3 distribution of MVS3.8J
Certainly not a native distribution, I have updated every utility
shipped with it to later versions as I find them.

But I have found a need (or an itch) to create additional tools
that fit my specific needs, so here they are.

Miscellaneous utilities I have used to make MVS3.8J under hercules
more totally hands off and user friendly for myself.
I believe all have now been converted to work with Turnkey3.

Pushed to github as I don't want to lose the code, and my dev machine
is failing and may be dead by the time anyone reads this.

The comments in each file should contain documentation and 
installation instructions.

Additional documentation and the latest test versions will be at
http://mdickinson.dyndns.org/hercules/downloads/
as long as that server survives, and eventually be back after I
get a new one.

The sections are currently
==========================
linux     - scripts used to make running TK3 under hercules easier
mvs38j    - various utilities I needed to make the system look 
            after itself
mvs38j_personal_usermods - SMP usermods I need that I don't want to
            accidentally misplace so backed up here
