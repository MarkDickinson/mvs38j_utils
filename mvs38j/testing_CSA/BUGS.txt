One known bug.
Two items to note.

(1) In the main MDCSAALC program
 a- If a reply other than WIPECSA is given to the WTOR prompting
    to confirm the request it correctly refuses to do anything
    but then SOC4s, so I have clobered the return address somewhere
 b- If WIPECSA refuses to run due to slots being in use it correctly
    refuses to do anything but then SOC4s, so I have clobered the
    return address somewhere
 The b check runs after the a so a coomon issue probably caused
 prior to a... does not impact memory management

(2) Hmmm, more of a note
    The MDCAREL macro was failing to release memory with a error
    on the FREEMAIN. ...BUT... it just suddenly started working
    after I put debug statements in and kept working after I took
    the debug statements out; no changes anywhere else.
    So it is not a bug, but still in tjis list as I do not know
    what was happening.

(3) Another note
    I have tested only with the slots near the top of the table,
    I have not tested all the way thru to table full logic and
    releasing memory from slot-ids out of order.
    THIS IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS.
